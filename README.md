### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Ethan Helder** and I am a data scientist with a focus on data mining.

My data science journey began at Flatiron School, where I graduated from the data science coding boot-camp in December 2021. I already had experience programming so combining math/statistics with programming caught my attention. At Flatiron, I learned how to use Python, SQL, and various data science libraries and tools like pandas and matplotlib to analyze, visualize, predict data. I completed several technical projects, such as using a decision tree classifier to predict water pump repairs in Tanzania and using neural networks to classify X-ray images of pediatric patients. I also developed my soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, by working with peers, instructors, and mentors. I leveraged my certification and was able to land a job at a startup digital marketing agency called LaFleur Marketing. 

As a Data Scientist at LaFleur Marketing, I applied my passion for data mining and machine learning to create value for clients and stakeholders. I orchestrated the migration from Domo to the Google Cloud Platform, lowering cloud infrastructure costs by 90%. I engineered and executed end-to-end ETL pipelines, slashing data transformation time by 30%. I created and deployed machine learning models using Scikit Learn to aid business insights and decision making. I also created Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards with custom Sankey models for comprehensive insights, and automated client reporting, resulting in a 75% reduction in time spent on these tasks.

Unfortunately, LaFleur recently had finacial troubles and I was laid off.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working** on a World of Warcraft analysis project. I use their API to extract data, python to preprocess data and Postgres SQL to store and aggregate datasets to visualize. I am working on setting up a web interface to easily see and interact with the visuals.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** more about networking. I recently setup a pi-hole for my home and am having a blast learning more about the Internet of Things and how to keep your connections secure. 
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help** with getting a job. I want your constructive critism on my profiles and resume. If you have any tips on what to learn or focus on to increase the chances of getting an interview, I would love to hear it. Better yet, if you know of or have a job that I am qualified for, I would love to have a conversation around how I can add value.

 I am currently looking for a fulltime position as a Data Scientist or related position.
 on 2 different projects. The first being an exploratory data analysis of League of Legends games. What makes this interesting is that I am sourcing all of the data completely on my own using Riots API. So my first step is to create a pipeline where I can send the raw API through and get a comprehensive summary of each game per row. My second project is a Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews. I am collaborating with a Professor from Harvard who teaches statistics. I teach him aboout Natural Language Processing and more advanced Data Engineering methods while he teaches me more about statistical analysis.
 more about SQL through a course on Udemy and HackerRank problems. My next course that I plan to go through is for Excel. Although I have a pretty good handle on it, I want to be able to create a data science project from start to finish with Excel.
