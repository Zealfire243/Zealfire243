### Hello there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on 2 different projects. The first being an exploratory data analysis of League of Legends games. What makes this interesting is that I am sourcing all of the data completely on my own using Riots API. So my first step is to create a pipeline where I can send the raw API through and get a comprehensive summary of each game per row. My second project is a Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews. I am collaborating with a Professor from Harvard who teaches statistics. I teach him aboout Natural Language Processing and more advanced Data Engineering methods while he teaches me more about statistical analysis.
-  🌱 I’m currently learning more about SQL through a course on Udemy and HackerRank problems. My next course that I plan to go through is for Excel. Although I have a pretty good handle on it, I want to be able to create a data science project from start to finish with Excel.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
My name is Ethan Helder and I am a data scientist. I recently graduated from Flatiron School and had been working in the food service industry for 7 years. I have been a kitchen assistant, server, bartender and a shift manager. I learned how to work under immense amount of pressure while effectively communicating to everyone around me to allow everything to go smoothly. My greatest accomplishment while serving was that me and two other servers worked together to serve a party of over 60 people. They all got different drinks and meals and we had to keep track of everything as a team. We made not a single mistake and by the time is was over our tip was around $2500 or a little over $800 each.
