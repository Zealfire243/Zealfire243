### Hello there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 different projects. The first being an exploratory data analysis of League of Legends games. What makes this interesting is that I am sourcing all of the data completely on my own using Riots API. So my first step is to create a pipeline where I can send the raw API through and get a comprehensive summary of each game per row. My second project is a Sentiment Analysis of Amazon reviews. I am collaborating with a Professor from Harvard who teaches statistics. I teach him aboout Natural Language Processing and more advanced Data Engineering methods while he teaches me more about statistical analysis.
-  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about SQL through a course on Udemy and HackerRank problems. My next course that I plan to go through is for Excel. Although I have a pretty good handle on it, I want to be able to create a data science project from start to finish with Excel.
